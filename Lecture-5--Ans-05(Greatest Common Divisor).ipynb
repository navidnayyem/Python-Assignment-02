    "# 5.The GCD (greatest common divisor) of two numbers is the largest number that both are di-visible by. For instance, gcd (18, 42) is 6 because the largest number that both 18 and 42 are divisible by is 6. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and computes their gcd. Shown below is a way to compute the GCD, called Euclid’s Algorithm.\n",
